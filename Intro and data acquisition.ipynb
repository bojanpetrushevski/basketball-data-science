        "---\n",
        "As data science has contributed in other fields of life, it can also improve and enrich the quality of perspective that basketball strategists have on the game of basketball. This project's focus would be analysing data for [NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association) basketball players who played in the past couple of years. Since today's NBA is far more different than decades ago, there are many unpredictive facts that a naked eye cannot notice. There is where data science can come in handy. My idea is that we can analyze a dataset in order to accomplish prediction of some useful information about the players. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, I am planning to predict the win shares (player statistic which attempts to divvy up credit for team success to the individuals on the team, per [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html)) which a single player has according to his statistics during some previous season. This could be predicted using other given statistic information about the player as the number of shots he takes in a game, the shooting percentage, the points percentage of a player, etc... This information could be useful to office executives of every NBA team such as general managers, scouts, risk managers, assitant managers and other front office staff so they can see the big picture of what players are cruicial for what teams and even more important - if they expect from a player to perform with certain statistic next season, how much it will really contribute on a team level. Technically spoken, this output should can be continious so I could use some of the following techniques: linear regression, support vector regression, k-nearest-neighbors, decision tree regression. I will try to train a model using more of them a compare the results to see which algorithm is the most accurate for this kind of problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Another idea that I have is that I can predict player position based on his other statistics as well since an NBA player can behave as a playmaker even though in reality his [original position](https://www.myactivesg.com/Sports/Basketball/How-To-Play/Basketball-Rules/Basketball-Positions-and-Roles) is a forward or maybe even center. Again, this kind of analysis could help the front offices of NBA teams to determine what kind of players (position-wise) they really have and what position holes need to be filled in a certain NBA teams. Since this output would be categorical, I thought of using some techniques like neural networks, decision trees classification, rule-based classification, etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, my point would be to try as many techniques as my time and resources would allow me from the ones that I was introduced during the Data Mining course. It will be interesting to analyze the final results that different algorithms will produce on the same dataset.\n"

        "The second dataset I will analyze in this project is ready-to-go dataset which I found on kaggle. This dataset is about the former NBA basketball player [Kobe Bryant's all career shots](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection). Every instance contains features as distance from where the shot was took, what type of shot it was, how many minutes remain to the end of the quarter, etc... The task is to make a classification based on the features that would predict whether Kobe Bryant scored the shot or not. This problem again seems interesting to me and is another opportunity to try various machine learning algorithms and techniques that I studied during the Data Mining course."
